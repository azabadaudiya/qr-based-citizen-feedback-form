# qr-based-citizen-feedback-form
I developed a feedback system for police stations as part of SSIP's New India Vibrant Hackathon 2023. This project allows citizens to provide feedback easily by scanning a QR code posted in the police station. They can fill out a feedback form online, which any authorized officer can monitor. Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, I created an application that calculates public perception of the police in different levels of jurisdiction, from station to city. This project has the potential to enhance community-police relations and improve law enforcement services.
